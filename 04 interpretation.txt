the output 04 for both the Classification Tree and the Logistic Regression model:

### Classification Tree:

Model Summary:
- Growing Method (CHAID): The classification tree was built using the CHAID algorithm, which automatically detects interactions between variables to create the tree.
- Dependent Variable (HeartDisease): The variable being predicted by the model.
- Independent Variables: Features used to predict heart disease, including age, sex, chest pain type, etc.
- Validation: No validation method was applied.
- Maximum Tree Depth: The tree was limited to a depth of 3 levels to avoid overfitting.
- Minimum Cases in Parent Node: A split was made only if there were at least 100 cases in the parent node.
- Minimum Cases in Child Node: Each resulting child node needed to have at least 50 cases.

Results:
- Independent Variables Included in Tree: ST_Slope, ChestPainType, RestingECG, Oldpeak, MaxHR: These variables were chosen as the most significant predictors by the algorithm.
- Number of Nodes: The tree has 16 nodes in total.
- Number of Terminal Nodes: There are 9 terminal nodes, which are the end points where predictions are made.
- Depth: The maximum depth of the tree is 3.

Risk Estimate:
- Estimate: The estimated risk of heart disease based on the classification tree is 0.157, with a standard error of 0.012.

Classification:
- Overall Percentage Correct: 84.3%: The overall accuracy of the model in predicting heart disease.
- Observed vs. Predicted: The percentage of correct predictions for each class.

### Logistic Regression:

Model Summary:
- Method (Enter): All independent variables were entered into the model simultaneously.
- Dependent Variable (HeartDisease): The variable being predicted.
- Independent Variables: Features included in the logistic regression model.
- Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients: Indicates the overall significance of the model.
- -2 Log likelihood: A measure of model fit.
- Cox & Snell R Square: An indicator of the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- Nagelkerke R Square: Similar to Cox & Snell R Square, but adjusted for sample size and number of predictors.

Classification Table:
- Overall Percentage Correct: The percentage of correct predictions made by the logistic regression model.
- Observed vs. Predicted: The percentage of correct predictions for each class.

Variables in the Equation:
- Coefficients, standard errors, Wald statistics, degrees of freedom, and significance levels for each predictor included in the model.

In summary, both models aim to predict heart disease, with the classification tree offering a more interpretable structure of decision rules, while logistic regression provides coefficients indicating the strength and direction of the relationship between predictors and the outcome.
