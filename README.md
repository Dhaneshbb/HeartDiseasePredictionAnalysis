# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis
this repository containing analyses and models for predicting heart disease. It includes clustering analyses, classification tree, and logistic regression models applied to dataset USING THE # SPSS.
**README**

aimed at predicting heart failure,

1. **Descriptive Statistics and Missing Value Analysis:**
   - Provides descriptive statistics such as mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis for key variables related to heart disease prediction.
   - Analyzes missing values and identifies extreme values for each variable.
   
2. **T-Test for Equality of Means:**
   - Assesses the significant difference in means between two groups for variables such as age and cholesterol level.
   - Reports t-test statistics and p-values for each variable.

3. **Regression Analysis:**
   - Evaluates the regression model's performance in predicting age based on several predictors.
   - Reports R-squared, adjusted R-squared, standard error of the estimate, and Durbin-Watson statistic.
   
4. **Pearson Correlation Matrix:**
   - Examines the correlation between various variables, such as age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart disease.
   - Provides insights into the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
   
5. **ANOVA Table:**
   - Analyzes the differences in means between groups for variables like age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and others.
   - Reports F-statistics and p-values to determine the significance of group differences.
   
6. **Chi-Square Test:**
   - Applies Fisher's exact test to determine significant associations between categorical variables.
   - Reports the p-value to assess the significance of the association.
   
7. **Factor Analysis:**
   - Investigates the relationship between variables and identifies underlying factors.
   - Reports component loadings for each variable in the dataset.
   
8. **Clustering Analysis (BAVERAGE and QUICK):**
   - Utilizes two clustering algorithms (BAVERAGE and QUICK) to group similar cases together based on heart disease prediction variables.
   - Reports cluster centers, number of cases in each cluster, and ANOVA results.
   
9. **Classification Tree and Logistic Regression:**
   - Constructs a classification tree and logistic regression model to predict heart disease.
   - Reports model summaries, risk estimates, classification accuracy, and coefficients for predictor variables.
